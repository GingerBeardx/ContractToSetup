The purpose of this program is to take a proeprty list from an excel sheet, open each 
property's service contract and extract the billing methods. The active billing methods 
for the property will then be pulled from a seperate excel file that has the billing 
methodology for each property. A comparison will then be made between the methods and 
show what matches and what varies from the service contract. The results will then be 
saved in another excel file.
